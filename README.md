ðŸŒŸ Project Highlight: Blinkit Clone - Frontend Design ðŸŒŸ

Excited to share my latest project, a Blinkit Clone built entirely using HTML and CSS! ðŸ›’ While it's focused on the frontend, this project showcases the design and structure of an on-demand grocery delivery platform.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Responsive Design: Ensured the layout adapts seamlessly across devices, offering a smooth user experience on mobile and desktop.
Clean UI: Focused on a user-friendly, minimalistic design for easy navigation and product browsing.
Layout Components: Structured the homepage, product lists, and order pages with attention to detail.
Interactive Elements: Used CSS for hover effects, buttons, and other engaging elements without JavaScript.
ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:

HTML5 for structure and content
CSS3 for styling and responsive layout
This project helped me improve my skills in designing modern and responsive UIs using just HTML and CSS. It also gave me a deeper understanding of building layouts similar to real-world applications.
